# Prefetching

Loadable Components is fully compatible with [webpack hints `webpackPrefetch` and `webpackPreload`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#prefetching-preloading-modules).

Most of the time, you want to "prefetch" a component, it means it will be loaded when the browser is idle. You can do it by adding `/* webpackPrefetch: true */` inside your import statement.

```js
import loadable from '@loadable/component'

const OtherComponent = loadable(() =>
  import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ './OtherComponent')
)
```

> You can extract prefetched resources server-side to add `<link rel="prefetch">` in your head.
