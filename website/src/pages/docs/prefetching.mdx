# Prefetching

Loadable Components is fully compatible with [webpack hints `webpackPrefetch` and `webpackPreload`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#prefetching-preloading-modules).

Most of the time, you want to "prefetch" a component, it means it will be loaded when the browser is idle. You can do it by adding `/* webpackPrefetch: true */` inside your import statement.

```js
import loadable from '@loadable/component'

const OtherComponent = loadable(() =>
  import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ './OtherComponent'),
)
```

> You can extract prefetched resources server-side to add `<link rel="prefetch">` in your head.

## Manually preload a component

It is possible to _force_ the preload of a component. It has the same effect as if the component is rendered for the first time.

It can be useful to trigger a `preload` on mouse over:

```js
import loadable from '@loadable/component'

const Infos = () => loadable(() => './Infos')

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div>
      <a onMouseOver={() => Infos.preload()} onClick={() => setShow(true)}>
        Show Infos
      </a>
      {show && <Infos />}
    </div>
  )
}

const OtherComponent = loadable(() =>
  import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ './OtherComponent'),
)
```

> `preload` is not available server-side, you should only call it client-side. If you want to use prefetching server-side, use webpack hints instead.

> `preload` is aggressive and doesn't take care of network condition and data saving preference of the user. You should call it carefully.
