# Error Boundaries

If the other module fails to load (for example, due to network failure), it will trigger an error. You can handle these errors to show a nice user experience and manage recovery with [Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html). Once you’ve created your Error Boundary, you can use it anywhere above your lazy components to display an error state when there’s a network error.

```js
import MyErrorBoundary from '/MyErrorBoundary'
const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import('./OtherComponent'))
const AnotherComponent = loadable(() => import('./AnotherComponent'))

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <MyErrorBoundary>
      <section>
        <OtherComponent />
        <AnotherComponent />
      </section>
    </MyErrorBoundary>
  </div>
)
```
