# Delay

To avoid flashing a loader if the loading is very fast, you could implement a minimum delay. There is no built-in API in `@loadable/component` but you could do it using [`p-min-delay`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-min-delay).

```js
import loadable from '@loadable/component'
import pMinDelay from 'p-min-delay'

// Wait a minimum of 200ms before loading home.
export const OtherComponent = loadable(() =>
  pMinDelay(import('./OtherComponent'), 200)
)
```
